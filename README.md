# NoteTaker

Heroku: https://limitless-mountain-22019.herokuapp.com/notes

In this project, the front end was built so that you can add new notes, delete notes, and store these notes. The notes are listed on the left column. When you click the pencil on the top right you are able to write a new note. When you click on the trash can, it should then delete the notes for you. The main focus in this project were the server, note storage, and routes.
